# MateCli 

A new Flutter project for get weather forecast.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Successfully conceptualized and developed the "MateCli" mobile application, a user-friendly solution designed to provide real-time weather updates. MateCli is equipped with robust error handling mechanisms, ensuring smooth user experience even in scenarios where data retrieval might encounter issues. This application enables users to effortlessly access the current weather conditions for their current location or any city of their choice through a seamless search functionality. Leveraging the OpenWeather API and the versatile Flutter framework, I brought this project to life, ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. "MateCli" showcases my ability to integrate third-party APIs, create responsive mobile interfaces, and deliver practical solutions that enhance user engagement and convenience.
